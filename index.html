    <h1>Campaign Cracked</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Independent analysis of Indian brand strategy—beyond the hype.</p>

    <h2>The Problem with Marketing Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Most campaign breakdowns stop at "creative execution" or "virality metrics." They celebrate the <em>what</em> without questioning the <em>why</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campaign Cracked goes deeper. Every case study here dissects the <strong>consumer insight</strong>, <strong>brand positioning</strong>, and <strong>strategic intent</strong> behind Indian campaigns—then asks the uncomfortable question: <em>Did this actually solve a business problem?</em>
    </p>

    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
    <p>
      This isn't about whether an ad looked good or went viral. It's about whether the strategy behind it was sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each analysis applies frameworks from brand strategy, consumer psychology, and competitive positioning to evaluate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What consumer truth the campaign identified (or missed)</li>
      <li>Whether the brand's positioning justified the creative approach</li>
      <li>What worked, what failed, and what alternatives existed</li>
    </ul>
