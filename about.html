<h1>About Campaign Cracked</h1>

<p>
Campaign Cracked was created to move beyond surface-level advertising analysis
and understand the strategic intent behind real-world marketing campaigns.
</p>

<p>
This project applies formal concepts such as consumer behavior, segmentation,
positioning, and brand strategy to real Indian campaigns.
</p>

<p>
The goal is simple: <strong>think like a strategist, not a spectator</strong>.
